The Why
========
This project is designed to provide many of the same features that elasticsearch-head gives us, but through an IOS interface!  I'm doing this as a practical way to learn XCode and IOS, but I think it would be fun to be able to browse, search and manage an ES instance via your iPhone or iPad.
